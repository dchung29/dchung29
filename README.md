## hi, i’m da yun 👋

i’m a systems design engineering student @ uWaterloo who loves building things — from backend services to scrappy little tools and dashboards.

---

#### what i like working on 

- backend & infra: apis, data pipelines, observability, “why is this thing on fire?”
- distributed systems & streaming: kafka, queues, logs, time-series… all the fun chaos
- product-y engineering: talking to users, scoping features, then shipping the thing™

#### a few things in my toolbox

`go` · `python` · `typescript`  
`graphql` · `postgres` · `sqlite`  
`kafka` · `kubernetes` · `aws`  


#### currently

- building: internal tools, and infra that makes other engineers’ lives easier  
- learning: more about reliability, monitoring, and how to wake up pager duty in the best way possible
