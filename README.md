## hi, i’m da yun 👋

i’m a systems design engineering student @ uWaterloo who loves building things — from backend services to scrappy little tools and dashboards.

---

#### what i like working on 

- backend & infra: data pipelines, observability, internal tools that makes other engineers’ lives easier  
- distributed systems & streaming: kafka, queues, logs, time-series… all the fun chaos
- learning: more about reliability, monitoring, and how to wake up pager duty in the best way possible

#### a few things in my toolbox

`go` · `python` · `typescript`  
`graphql` · `postgres` · `sqlite`  
`kafka` · `kubernetes` · `aws`
